# C++ Concurrency in Action (2nd Edition)

## Highlights from Chapter 03 - "Sharing data between threads"

### Best line of the book
I love an analogy.
> _"Unless you’re particularly friendly, you can’t both use the bathroom at the same time, ..."_ – pg. 36

#
### Invariants
Invariants are statements that hold true about a particular data structure, but which are often broken during an update e.g. the example used in the book uses a doubly-linked list.

Some more [Mermaid magic](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/gitgraph.html) below.

```mermaid
---
title: Doubly-linked List
---
%%{init: { 'logLevel': 'debug', 'theme': 'base', 'gitGraph': {'showBranches': true, 'rotateCommitLabel': false, 'mainBranchName': 'Original'}} }%%
gitGraph
   commit id: "1"
   commit id: "2"
   branch Removal
   checkout Original
   commit id: "3"
   checkout Removal
   commit id: "->" type:REVERSE
   checkout Original
   merge Removal id: "4" type:NORMAL
   commit id: "5"
```
